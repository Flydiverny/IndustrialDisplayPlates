# Display Plates

Mainly doing this to try out Factorio modding and I wanted to be able to select from more signals! May or may not be fully working currently, but published regardless so I can use it in my server!

### How to change from IndustrialDisplayPlates -> DisplayPlates

If you want to try out this mod and are switching from IndustrialDisplayPlates, please enable it side by side with IndustrialDisplayPlates, that allows this mod to copy over the state from IndustrialDisplayPlates, if you disable IndustrialDisplayPlates first you will have to reconfigure all of your existing plates!

### Features

Big, medium and small signs to display item and fluid icons. Can be used to blueprint map markers.

### Locale

If you want to contribute by translating this mod, you can view the existing translations [here](https://github.com/Flydiverny/IndustrialDisplayPlates/tree/master/locale). I'd be happy to add your language and credits to the next release.
