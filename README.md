# Display Plates

Did this as I wanted to be able to select from more signals then published my first mod so I could use it on my own server!
The [original mod (IndustrialDisplayPlates)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialDisplayPlates) has since been updated but the experience is still a bit different, mainly which UI is in use. Use whichever one you prefer!

This changes the UI to use the native signal selector. It does require an extra click to open, sadly, but it gives you the same behavior as when selecting signals in other native frames.

### How to change from IndustrialDisplayPlates -> DisplayPlates

If you want to try out this mod and are switching from IndustrialDisplayPlates, please enable it side by side with IndustrialDisplayPlates, that allows this mod to copy over the state from IndustrialDisplayPlates, if you disable IndustrialDisplayPlates first you will have to reconfigure all of your existing plates!

### Features

Big, medium and small signs ("plates") which display item and fluid icons.
Display plates can be set to create a matching map marker at the location of the display plate.
Can be used with blueprints, (except updating blueprints)

### Locale
